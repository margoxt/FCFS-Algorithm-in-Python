# FCFS Scheduling Algorithm in Python

This project implements the **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm using Python.  
It simulates how processes are executed based on their arrival time and calculates:

- Completion Time
- Turnaround Time
- Waiting Time

---

## 📌 What is FCFS?

FCFS (First Come First Serve) is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first gets executed first — just like a queue.

---

## 🧠 Input Format

Each process is written as:

```python
[arrival_time, burst_time, process_id]
